# Survive

This project is my final Frontend Capstone. The purpose of this application is to help users survive the end of the world zombie apocalpyse. 

## Description

Users can report zombie sightings, find directions to safe towns, trade goods with other users, use the National Parks services to train, and see a scrolling list of the most recent zombies near them.

### Zombies Page
See a list of zombie sightings. Click see details to see more about the sighting: how far it is from a town, who posted it, and whether or not you want to update the status

### Trades Page
See a list of user trades. Click on the details to see if the trade has been accepted. Accept trade if wanted

### Towns Page
See available towns. Whether or not there are vacancies. Click Homes Available or no vacacy to pull up a map to the town and get directions from your location. 

### Parks Page
See a list of National Parks. Choose a state to see what available trainings are in your area.

## Most Proud

I am most proud of using two outside APIs (the National Park Services and Google Maps). I also spent a lot of time figuring out modals.

# Extras

Here are a few things I could have added but ran out of time.
1. Trade List - I realized that it would be nice to have confirmation before deleting something or maybe only allowing adminstrators. Also having directions between user towns once trades are completed.
2. Back and Cancel buttons would've been nice.
3. Allowing users to see their past trades and maybe even rating them.
4. Seeing whether or not trades have already been accepted with an icon or some other means.


### This app uses react, tailwindcss, Google Maps, and the National Parks Services

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

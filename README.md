# Survive

This project is my final Frontend Capstone. The purpose of this application is to help users survive the end of the world zombie apocalpyse. 

## Description

Users can report zombie sightings, find directions to safe towns, trade goods with other users, use the National Parks services to train, and see a scrolling list of the most recent zombies near them.

### Zombies Page
See a list of zombie sightings. Click see details to see more about the sighting: how far it is from a town, who posted it, and whether or not you want to update the status

### Trades Page
See a list of user trades. Click on the details to see if the trade has been accepted. Accept trade if wanted

### Towns Page
See available towns. Whether or not there are vacancies. Click Homes Available or no vacacy to pull up a map to the town and get directions from your location. 

### Parks Page
See a list of National Parks. Choose a state to see what available trainings are in your area.

## Most Proud

I am most proud of using two outside APIs (the National Park Services and Google Maps). I also spent a lot of time figuring out modals.

# Extras

Here are a few things I could have added but ran out of time.
1. Trade List - I realized that it would be nice to have confirmation before deleting something or maybe only allowing adminstrators. Also having directions between user towns once trades are completed.
2. Back and Cancel buttons would've been nice.
3. Allowing users to see their past trades and maybe even rating them.
4. Seeing whether or not trades have already been accepted with an icon or some other means.


### This app uses react, tailwindcss, Google Maps, and the National Parks Services
